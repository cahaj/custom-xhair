# Custom Crosshair Overlay
Displays a custom png crosshair in the middle of the screen that is fully resizable.
## Image rules
- ratio of the image must be 1:1
- to achieve transparency, you must use black (0, 0, 0, 100) as an indicator for where the trasparency should be, support for custom traparency colors is coming soon

### Example:
